\chapter*{Foreword}

This is a summary for the course Gedistribueerde systemen\footnote{\url{http://onderwijsaanbod.kuleuven.be/syllabi/n/H04I4AN.htm}} given by Prof. Dr. Joosen\footnote{\url{https://distrinet.cs.kuleuven.be/people/wouter}} and Dr. Walraven\footnote{\url{https://distrinet.cs.kuleuven.be/people/showMember.do?memberID=u0059786}} at the Catholic University of Louvain\footnote{\url{http://www.kuleuven.be/english}} (KUL). The contents of this text are based on the book "Distributed Systems: Concepts and Design (5th Edition)"\footnote{\url{http://www.cdk5.net/wp/}} by Coulouris et al. and the lecture slides.

Note that this is not a complete summary and may become outdated as the contents of the course change over the years. I can also not guarantee that there are no errors in this text, so be aware of that. Other than that, feel free to use this text while studying the course.

This text is also available at \url{http://districted.wordpress.com/concepts/distributed-systems/}. The text on that website may be a bit more up-to-date, depending on how much work I'm willing to put into it. If there are any mistakes or you would like to give some feedback, feel free to let me know on that website.
